# Magic 8 Ball

An exercise, where I build a simulation of a classic kid’s toy, the `Magic 8 Ball`.

The `Magic 8 Ball` is a plastic sphere, made to look like an oversized eight ball, that is used for fortune-telling or seeking advice. It was invented in 1946 by Albert C. Carter and Abe Bookman and is currently manufactured by Mattel. The user asks a yes–no question to the ball, then turns it over to reveal an answer that floats up into a window.

To run the App:
